### Profile

I have had a life-long interest in the nitty-gritty of computers, spending countless hours of free time tinkering and experimenting with software and hardware. Despite that preoccupation in all things PC, the last decade was a winding detour into other fields of study and work, taking me from the rainy Pacific Northwest to the scorching heat of Dubai, and now to London.

During that detour, I retained my interest in becoming a programmer, and it took me until recently to get back on track. Forgoing the path of going back to university and getting a degree in Computer Science, I instead attended Makers Academy in London, an intensive sixteen-week web development bootcamp course.

It wasn't an easy decision to end my previous career path and move to a new country, without any guarantee that I would succeed, but in retrospect that decision was well made. During this course, I spent 40+ hours a week developing a skill-set and focus on agile, object-orientated programming design. The skills and projects described below are just the beginning of my self-education, as I am continuing to actively expand my knowledge.

I am excited to start a junior developer job, especially one that comes with opportunities to learn, facilitate career growth, contribute to interesting projects, and be part of a team of friendly folks.

#### Fast Learner & Seek Challenges

For the Makers Academy final project, I created a game entirely in vanilla JavaScript and HTML5, and managed to build a fully functioning game that included simulated physics, collision detection, multiplayer, and a VR-mode. All this was done within two weeks, and without using any additional frameworks (besides A-Frame used for VR). This project can be found [here](http://makeroids.herokuapp.com/).

#### Attention to Detail

A skill that I developed while being a contract bid specialist is poring over potential clients' requirements, no matter how concise or verbose, to identify areas to focus on during tight time-frames and maximize the chance for contractual awards. This involved exhaustive research and consolidating disparate sources of information, whether by searching online or interviewing experts. That experience has taught me to maintain a macro and micro-scopic view of complex projects.

#### Team-Player

I leave my ego outside of interactions with colleagues during projects, and this can sometimes be seen as shyness, but my aim is to emphasize cohesion of team-efforts. Any disagreements I might have are brought forward in the form of helpful suggestions and questions, to maintain the XP values of communication and respect.

## <a name="Hobbies">Hobbies and interests</a>

I am a movie-buff, especially foreign and documentary films, the more eye-opening the better. It’s cheaper than travelling, that’s for sure.

Another interest is video games/interactive-art, especially the experimental VR content coming out for mobile and desktop VR-headsets. I plan to create WebVR content (using Three.js and A-Frame) as a hobbyist and hopefully in a professional capacity in the near future.

Slightly different than my other interests, I cannot get enough of hiking deep in the woods, away from city noise.
