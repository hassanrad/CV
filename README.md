### My Story

I have had a life-long interest, since early childhood, in the nitty-gritty of computers, spending countless hours of free time modifying and experimenting with software and hardware. Despite that underlying interest in PCs, the last 10 years were a winding detour into other fields of study and work, taking me from the rainy Pacific Northwest to the scorching heat of Dubai, and now to London.

I attended Makers Academy, a sixteen-week course, in pursuit of an opportunity to become proficient in building virtual solutions to problems in creative ways. During this course, I developed a skill-set and focus on agile, object-orientated design. I am searching for a junior developer job with opportunities to learn, and contribute to interesting projects.

#### Fast Learner & Seek Challenges

For the Makers Academy final project, I created a game entirely in vanilla JavaScript and HTML5, and managed to build a fully functioning game that included simulated physics, collision detection, multiplayer, and a VR-mode. All this was done within two weeks, and without using any additional frameworks (besides A-Frame used for VR). This project can be found [here](http://makeroids.herokuapp.com/).

#### Attention to Detail

A skill that I developed while being a contract bid specialist is poring over potential clients' requirements, no matter how concise or verbose, to identify areas to focus on during tight time-frames and maximize the chance for contractual awards. This involved exhaustive research and consolidating disparate sources of information, whether by searching online or interviewing experts. That experience has taught me to maintain a macro and micro-scopic view of complex projects.

#### Team-Player

I leave my ego outside of interactions with colleagues during projects, and this can sometimes be seen as shyness, but my aim is to emphasize cohesion of team-efforts. Any disagreements I might have are brought forward in the form of helpful suggestions and questions, to maintain the XP values of communication and respect.

## <a name="Hobbies">Hobbies and interests</a>

I am a movie-buff, with a strong emphasis on foreign and documentary films, the more eye-opening the better.

Another interest is video games/interactive-art, especially the burgeoning experimential VR content coming out for mobile and desktop VR-headsets.

Slightly different than my other interests, I cannot get enough of hiking in the woods, away from city noise.

**Gulf Supplies & Commercial Services** (February 2013 to May 2016)  
I worked as a Contract Bid Specialist, focused on the Middle East market. This involved working on multiple bid efforts simultaneously on tight-deadlines, writing technical proposals, and creating digital marketing material.
