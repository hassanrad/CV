### Profile

Hassan, a graduate of Communications from Portland State University, has had a life-long interest in computers, having spent much of his free time experimenting with both software and hardware engineering. Immediately after graduation, Hassan proactively modified his employer’s website, improving its online booking system and inventory-price database. Although he was not working in a software development environment, he had to learn and apply PHP and SQL in order to complete his objectives.

With his newly realized interest in programming, he attended a web development bootcamp that focused on back-end and front-end technologies, including Ruby and JavaScript. During the course he collaborated with other developers on several projects, utilizing Agile methodologies such as pair programming, test-driven development and SCRUM.

His goal is to start a Software Development career after completing his FDM Java training, and ultimately becoming a Senior Developer.

#### Fast Learner & Seek Challenges

For the Makers Academy final project, Hassan created a game entirely in vanilla JavaScript and HTML5, and managed to build a fully functioning game that included simulated physics, collision detection, multiplayer, and a VR-mode. All this was done within two weeks, and without using any additional frameworks (besides A-Frame used for VR). This project can be found [here](http://makeroids.herokuapp.com/).

#### Attention to Detail

A skill that Hassan developed while being a contract bid specialist is poring over potential clients' requirements, no matter how concise or verbose, to identify areas to focus on during tight time-frames and maximize the chance for contractual awards. This involved exhaustive research and consolidating disparate sources of information, whether by searching online or interviewing experts. That experience has taught him to maintain a macro and micro-scopic view of complex projects.

#### Team-Player

Hassan leaves his ego outside of interactions with colleagues during projects, and this can sometimes be seen as shyness, but his aim is to emphasize cohesion of team-efforts. Any disagreements he might have are brought forward in the form of helpful suggestions and questions, to maintain the XP values of communication and respect.

Avid movie-buff, especially foreign and documentary films, the more eye-opening the better.

Video games / interactive-art, especially the experimental VR content coming out for mobile and desktop VR-headsets. Have started creating WebVR content (using Three.js and A-Frame) as a hobbyist and hopefully in a professional capacity in the near future.

Hiking deep in the woods, away from city noise.
