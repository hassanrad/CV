I am a former Contract Bid Specialist, and look forward to starting my career as a web developer. I attended Makers Academy, a twelve-week course, in pursuit of an opportunity to create solutions to problems in creative ways. During this course, I developed a skill-set and focus on agile, object-orientated design. I am searching for a junior developer job with opportunities to learn, and contribute to interesting projects.

#### Fast Learner & Seek Challenges

For the Makers Academy final project, I created a game entirely in vanilla JavaScript and HTML5, and managed to build a fully functioning game that included simulated physics, collision detection, multiplayer, and a VR-mode. All this was done within two weeks, and without using any additional frameworks (besides A-Frame used for VR). This project can be found [here](http://makeroids.herokuapp.com/).

#### Attention to Detail

A skill that I developed while being a contract bid specialist is poring over potential clients' requirements, no matter how concise or verbose, to identify areas to focus on during tight time-frames and maximize the chance for contractual awards. This involved exhaustive research and consolidating disparate sources of information, whether by searching online or interviewing experts. That experience has taught me to maintain a macro and micro-scopic view of complex projects.

#### Team-Player

I leave my ego outside of interactions with colleagues during projects, and this can sometimes be seen as shyness, but my aim is to emphasize cohesion of team-efforts. Any disagreements I might have are brought forward in the form of helpful suggestions and questions, to maintain the XP values of communication and respect.

I am a movie-buff, with a strong emphasis on foreign and documentary films, the more eye-opening the better.

A second interest is video games/interactive-art, especially the burgeoning experimential VR content coming out for mobile and desktop VR-headsets.
